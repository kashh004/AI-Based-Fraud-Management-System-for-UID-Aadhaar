# AI-Based Fraud Management System for UID Aadhaar

## Overview
This project implements an **AI-Based Fraud Management System** aimed at detecting and classifying fraudulent activities associated with UID Aadhaar data. The system leverages advanced machine learning techniques to identify anomalies and potential fraud, ensuring enhanced security and reliability for Aadhaar services.

## Key Features
- **Fraud Classification Model**:
  - Identifies whether given data indicates a potential fraud or legitimate use.
  - Provides insights into the type and nature of detected fraud.
- **Fraud Detection Model**:
  - Detects anomalies in Aadhaar transactions and flags suspicious activities.
  - Employs state-of-the-art techniques for high accuracy and precision.
- **Scalability**:
  - Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Interactive and intuitive interface for reviewing results and insights.

## Project Structure
The project consists of two main Jupyter Notebooks:

1. **Fraud Classification Notebook**
   - Implements a classification model to categorize data points as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
   - Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Fraud Detection Notebook**
   - Focuses on anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms.
   - Covers preprocessing, unsupervised learning techniques, and evaluation.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder (`data/` by default).
4. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment and execute the cells sequentially.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handles missing values, data normalization, and feature extraction.
2. **Model Training**:
   - For the classification notebook, supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost are used.
   - For the detection notebook, unsupervised algorithms like Isolation Forest or DBSCAN are implemented.
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification.
   - For anomaly detection, techniques like ROC-AUC and confusion matrices are employed.

## Outputs
- Classification results with predictions and probability scores.
- Detection results highlighting flagged anomalies in the dataset.
- Visualization of data trends and fraud patterns.

## Usage
- Load your dataset into the provided format and execute the notebooks.
- Review model outputs and insights to identify fraudulent activities.
- Modify parameters or algorithms as needed to improve performance.
